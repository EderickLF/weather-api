## GeoLocation
![GeoLocation](gitAssets/GeoLocationAPI.png)

Using Geolocation, we grab the current longitude and latitude and pass it on to the OpenWeatherAPI to grab the relevant data needed.

<br>

## OpenWeaterAPI
![WebPage](gitAssets/MainSearch.png)

This API lets you search specific city weathers based on name search, this API has limited calls on it and will refresh after a day

<br/>

Also, the API provides more services such as searching an area based on Longtitude and Latitude values "Hence the GeoLocation"

<br/>

# Future Updates

- Create a "Mobile First Approach"
- Redesign each card
- Add slide animation for main card once a search is initiated
